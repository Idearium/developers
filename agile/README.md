## Our process

We manage the delivery of the software we build using agile.

Agile is an iterative approach to software delivery that builds software incrementally from the start of the project, instead of trying to deliver it all at once near the end.

It works by breaking projects down into little bits of user functionality - user stories - prioritizing them, and continuously releasing functionality to the client throughout the project.

## Our tools

To manage projects we are using;

1. Jira - for issue tracking in Kanban boards
2. Confluence - for scoping documentation
3. Github - for release and version control
4. Slack - for team communication 

### Integrations

To improve the management of our projects we are working on aligning the functionality of our tools to ensure streamlined communication and the best team approach.
