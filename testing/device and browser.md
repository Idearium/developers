# Device testing

All Idearium web applications are 100% responsive which means they need to be tested across desktop, laptop, tablet and mobile devices.

During the development phase the developers should build using the Chrome developer tools [toggle device toolbar](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode/) to test an application.

In testing phase we are required to be more thorough and test on laptop, tablet and mobile directly and over multiple devices, more on that below.

# Browser testing
