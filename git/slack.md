# GitHub-Slack integration

We use Slack to notify us of any GitHub updates.
To integrate Slack into a new Slack channel, run `/github subscribe {repoowner/reponame}`.

In addition to the default features, we also include:

- `comments`
- `reviews`

These can be activated by running `/github subscribe {repoowner/reponame} comments reviews`.
