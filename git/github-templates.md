# GitHub templates

This is a collection of GitHub templates that should be used.

The purpose of a template, is so that all contributors can communicate in a clear and consistent way.

To install a template:

1. Create a folder in the repository's root directory called `.github`.
2. Add your template file e.g. `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`

Below are our currently used templates:
