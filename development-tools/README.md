# Idearium developer tools

This section provides information about our Idearium developer tools.

## Editors

The primary editor our developers use is Atom.

We have an [editor config](./.editorconfig) that you can use (once you have the plugin installed) to configure your editor for specific file types based on the Idearium standard.
