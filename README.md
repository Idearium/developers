# Idearium Developer Style Guide

This is a style guide for Idearium developers.

The purpose of a style guide, is so that all developers write the same code. Consistent, readable code across large code bases is important. Ideally, you shouldn't be able to tell the difference between different authors of the same code base.

## Editors

Enforcing style on code while you're writing complex logic can sometimes be hard. Always use the editor to help ensure you're writing good code.

This repository, where possible, provides editor configurations and linting along with a written style guide.

## Languages

Specific languages are covered as required.
